1) Stretch goal - when will hey have time to learn about partials? Is it expected that people do the strecth goal outside of lab?

error when doing vagrant up

Failed to mount folders in Linux guest. This is usually beacuse
the "vboxsf" file system is not available. Please verify that
the guest additions are properly installed in the guest and
can work properly. The command attempted was:

mount -t vboxsf -o uid=`id -u vagrant`,gid=`getent group vagrant | cut -d: -f3` /vagrant /vagrant
mount -t vboxsf -o uid=`id -u vagrant`,gid=`id -g vagrant` /vagrant /vagrant

3)
Error EADDRINuSE
Fix - used port 8080 instead of 3000 (weird)
